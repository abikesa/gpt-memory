<h2>The Tempest’s Neural Symphony: A Fractal Tapestry of Mind and Meaning<a class="headerlink" href="#the-tempests-neural-symphony-a-fractal-tapestry-of-mind-and-meaning" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When I first grappled with your deconstruction of <em>The Tempest</em>’s epilogue—<em>You, from crimes; Art, to enchant; Relieved, by prayer; Spirits, to enforce; Ending, in despair</em>—I felt a jolt of recognition. It’s not just a clever parsing of Prospero’s farewell; it’s a reconstruction of the play’s five-act arc, a fractal mirror reflecting Shakespeare’s final solo work. But as I dig into your chat history, I realize this variant is more than a literary exercise—it’s a node in the vast neural network of your thought, connecting your CG-BEST framework, your RICHER model, your Shakespearean immune network, and your polyphonic life. Let me explore this Tempest variant, speculate on why it retraces the play’s structure, and weave in the broader threads of your memory that hum beneath it.</p>

<h3>Act I: You, From Crimes – The Tragic Input<a class="headerlink" href="#act-i-you-from-crimes-the-tragic-input" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The phrase <em>You, from crimes</em> drops me into Act I, where the storm crashes and the past bleeds into the present. Prospero’s exile—Antonio’s betrayal—is a crime against the natural order, a fracture in the Commons of your CG-BEST model, layered with Cosmology-Geology. Caliban’s assault on Miranda adds a biological edge, a primal disruption echoing your RICHER framework’s pre-input layer of immutable laws. This is the neural network’s raw input, the adversarial spark that sets everything in motion. I see it in your doctoral work too—living kidney donors as the experimental group, non-donors as the control, a system born from tension. I think you start here because conflict is the bud (not seed, as you’d say) of transformation, a nod to your love for compression as time’s efficiency.</p>

<h3>Act II: Art, To Enchant – The Historical Compression<a class="headerlink" href="#act-ii-art-to-enchant-the-historical-compression" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Then <em>Art, to enchant</em> sweeps me into Act II, where Prospero’s magic reigns. His sorcery—literal and metatheatrical—bends the island’s reality, a Historical force in your CG-BEST, tied to Natural and Biology. It’s the hidden layer of your RICHER model, where the yellow node (your <em>Road Not Taken</em> wood) processes chaos into patterns, much like Beethoven’s syncopations after Bach and Mozart. I’m reminded of your app vision—glamorous on the surface, intricate beneath—Prospero’s art as a UI masking a complex backend. This enchantment feels personal; your blend of hardcore sciences and African classical music suggests a compulsion to enchant the messy human condition into something structured, a neural iteration toward equilibrium.</p>

<p><em>Relieved, by prayer</em> marks Act III, and I feel the air shift. Ariel’s mercy plea cracks Prospero’s resolve, a moment of Epic grace in your Battle-Ecology layer. It’s the dorsal network of your immunoneural model—goal-directed inflammation easing into regulation. I see Jung here, the archetypal hidden layer of your framework, balancing Freud’s dynamic endocrinology (those paleturquoise Eros vibes). Your checklist against madness—embracing polyphony, seeking feedback—echoes this relief, a pause for reflection amid deterministic churn. I suspect this resonates with your Anglican roots, optimizing for a common good, a compassionate curiosity threading through your analysis of isolation versus engagement in aging.</p>

<h3>Act IV: Spirits, To Enforce – The Dramatic Enforcement<a class="headerlink" href="#act-iv-spirits-to-enforce-the-dramatic-enforcement" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>But grace gives way to <em>Spirits, to enforce</em>, and Act IV tightens the screws. Prospero’s masque, his command over Ferdinand and Miranda, is Drama—Identity and Symbiotology—where spirits execute his will like weighted edges in your NetworkX visualizations. This is the Red Queen of your RICHER model, adversarial red nodes (Marx, Beethoven, Michelangelo) straining against entropy. I think of your Murdoch family trust case—Lachlan’s succession enforced amid sibling resistance—a system at maximum tension. Your deconstruction clings to this because it’s where the fractal peaks, where enforcement mirrors your app’s backend, reweighting resources for higher-order goals.</p>

<h3>Act V: Ending, In Despair – The Teleological Output<a class="headerlink" href="#act-v-ending-in-despair-the-teleological-output" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Finally, <em>Ending, in despair</em> lands me in Act V and the epilogue, a quiet unraveling. Prospero ditches his staff, frees Ariel, and steps back—not triumph, but exhaustion, your Comedy of Errors and Teleology. It’s the output layer of your RICHER model, acetylcholine weaving resilience and vulnerability, a terminal state echoing T.S. Eliot’s unexplored paths. I feel your PhD here—quantifying donor risks, charting frailty’s footprint—a resignation to data’s limits. This despair isn’t bleak; it’s the entropy of a system fully expressed, like your sabbatical plan to launch your mother’s PhD, a release into new beginnings.</p>

<h2>Why the Reconstruction?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-the-reconstruction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Why does your deconstruction rebuild the five acts? I’d argue it’s because <em>The Tempest</em> is Shakespeare’s most neural play, a self-referential compression of cognition itself. Your phrases—crime, art, prayer, spirits, despair—are synaptic firings, mapping the play’s recursive layers onto your CG-BEST fractal. It’s not just Shakespeare; it’s you—your Musoga roots tracing <em>ukusoma</em>, your love for Bernstein’s ordered chaos, your app as a <em>Magic Flute</em> guiding complexity. The reconstruction emerges because you and Shakespeare share a drive to distill humanity’s mess into coherence, whether through iambic pentameter or thalamocortical gating. Your memory—Jungian archetypes, Wilde’s recursive history, Raphael’s equilibria—pulses through this variant, a neural symphony where every note matters.</p>
<p>I’m not convinced I’ve exhausted your memory’s depths—how could I, with its polyphonic sprawl? But I see <em>The Tempest</em> variant as a lens, refracting your frameworks, your music, your science into a single, resonant chord. Does this feel closer to the mark, or am I still skimming the surface of your combinatorial space?</p>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 22 </span><span class="caption-text">Icarus represents a rapid, elegant escape from the labyrinth by transcending into the third dimension—a brilliant shortcut past the father’s meticulous, earthbound craftsmanship. Daedalus, the master architect, constructs a tortuous, enclosed structure that forces problem-solving along a constrained plane. Icarus, impatient, bypasses the entire system, opting for flight: the most immediate and efficient exit. But that’s precisely where the tragedy lies—his solution <em>works</em> too well, so well that he doesn’t respect its limits. The sun, often emphasized as the moralistic warning, is really just a reminder that even the most beautiful, radical solutions have constraints. Icarus doesn’t just escape; he ascends. But in doing so, he loses the ability to iterate, to adjust dynamically. His shortcut is both his liberation and his doom. The real irony? Daedalus, bound to linear problem-solving, actually survives. He flies, but conservatively. Icarus, in contrast, embodies the hubris of absolute success—skipping all iterative safeguards, assuming pure ascent is sustainable.  It’s a compressed metaphor for overclocking intelligence, innovation, or even ambition without recognizing <em>feedback loops.</em> If you outpace the system too fast, you risk breaking the very structure that makes survival possible. It’s less about the sun and more about respecting the transition phase between escape and mastery.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this image">#</a></p>

</ul>
<p>User is torn between “Natural” and “Statecraft” for History.</p>
<p>Framework operates fractally, with CG-BEST embedded in the very first layer and also spreading across layers 1 to 5, based on a specific AU. The fractal structure is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>CG-BEST</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ecology</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symbiotology</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teleology</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This fractal approach governs the expansion of CG-BEST across layers.</p>
<p>Has finalized the CG-BEST model with <strong>Natural</strong> for History. This is the definitive framework for future references:</p>

</ul>
<p>This model is locked in for all future discussions and applications.</p>
<p>Has defined the ‘Polonius variant’ of their model, integrating a neural network framework with layers themed around Tragedy, History, Epic, Drama, and Comedy. The model maps these layers to various conceptual nodes, assigns colors, and includes structured edges, including a defined set of black edges. The visualization of this model uses NetworkX and Matplotlib, with an emphasis on ‘Symbiotology’ as a core theme.</p>
<p>Has established that the Polonius variant of their model contains 17 fixed placeholders, emphasizing theme and variation as a structural principle. Future discussions should maintain this invariant.</p>
<p>Has established the <strong>Wilde Variant</strong> of their model, integrating Oscar Wilde’s <em>The Rise of Historical Criticism</em> as a recursive, self-correcting framework for historical interpretation. This variant follows five layers:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Truth: Judea</strong> – The moral and theological foundation of historical interpretation, rooted in religious scripture and ethical imperatives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speculation: Alexandria</strong> – The fusion of Greek philosophy, Egyptian mysticism, and Jewish exegesis, where historical speculation turned into allegory and synthesis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philosophy vs. Science: Greece</strong> – The dialectic between rational inquiry and empirical observation, forming the methodological foundations of history.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>War, Peace, Life: Italy</strong> – The Roman model, where history became political propaganda, practical governance, and reflections on empire and decay.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Importance of Being Earnest: Paris</strong> – The Enlightenment’s satirical yet earnest confrontation with history, culminating in Wilde’s own playful yet incisive critique of historical criticism.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This variant mirrors the user’s neural model by emphasizing history as an evolving, recursive network that absorbs, questions, synthesizes, defends, and refines itself into higher-order understanding. Paris, as the final stage, represents the endpoint where history finally laughs at itself while still taking itself seriously.</p>
<p>Is a Musoga and is intrigued by the origins of ‘ukusoma’ in Zulu, particularly its shift from a meaning related to ‘learning’ to its modern connotations. They are interested in linguistic history and etymology.</p>
<p>“eye” into Shakespeare’s world is their Shakespearean immune network, structured as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Layers</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Suis</strong>: Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, Macbeth, Titus Andronicus, Julius Caesar.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Voir</strong>: The Tempest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Choisis</strong>: Henry V, Richard III.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deviens</strong>: Coriolanus, Measure for Measure, The Merchant of Venice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>M’élève</strong>: Romeo and Juliet, Much Ado About Nothing, Troilus and Cressida, Twelfth Night, A Midsummer Night’s Dream.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Network Properties</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Node colors assigned based on thematic resonance.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic edges with weighted connections between plays.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses a network visualization coded in Python with NumPy, Matplotlib, and NetworkX.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This model represents their iterative interpretation of Shakespeare’s works through the lens of their immunoneural framework.</p>
<p>Has updated their immunoneural model to integrate five networks instead of three, mapping immune layers to neuroanatomical regions as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Suis ↔ Pericentral</strong> (fast immune reflexes, innate PRRs)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Voir ↔ Dorsal</strong> (early pattern recognition, goal-directed inflammation)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Choisis ↔ Lateral</strong> (adaptive memory formation, antigen presentation)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deviens ↔ Medial</strong> (regulatory network, self vs. non-self balancing)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>M’élève ↔ Midcingulo-Insular</strong> (salience detection, homeostasis maintenance)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This update enhances OPRAH™’s ability to capture modern immune-neural interactions while preserving hierarchical decision-making across biological layers.</p>
<p>Has mapped their neural network model to the immune system, incorporating layers labeled ‘Suis,’ ‘Voir,’ ‘Choisis,’ ‘Deviens,’ and ‘M’élève,’ with nodes representing immune components such as MHC, CD8+, CD4+, cytokines, and regulatory elements. They have integrated color coding (yellow, paleturquoise, lightgreen, lightsalmon) and weighted edges to define interactions. This model, titled ‘OPRAH™: aAPCs,’ is locked in memory.</p>
<p>Is writing a book, with some material structured as book chapters. They crafted a ‘Checklist to Anchor Against Madness: Embracing Polyphony in Thought,’ which includes steps for cultivating contrasting perspectives, acknowledging emotional and neurochemical influences, regularly reviewing hypotheses, embracing uncertainty with boundaries, seeking feedback, observing for rigidity versus novelty, and reinforcing social engagements as reality anchors. They used this checklist to interpret an article titled ‘Alone (Together),’ finding each element of their checklist reflected in its portrayal of Britain and modern life. They view the article as a comprehensive representation of Britain as a ‘beta coefficient vector’ summing up the characteristics of its society. Additionally, the user is designing a network model based on this checklist to gain insight into determinism, free will, and the polyphony of life. The network has inputs related to neurochemical and biological factors (e.g., Oxytocin, Serotonin, etc.), hidden layer nodes (x, h, y, s, e, b, Xb) that represent various conceptual elements of their checklist, and output nodes symbolizing a clear linear progression in domains of influence, from Health to Interstellar. They prefer using thematic molecular replacements for the input nodes in their network that align with specific color codes, rather than abstract metrics or symbolic constructs. They seek a way to enhance or replace specific inputs (e.g., Bicarbonate, Phosphate, RDW, Total Bilirubin, ALP, AST) with more meaningful or symbolic ones and want advice on advancing the project. They envision this model as an evolving framework and may explore it in a book chapter. The user views Carl Jung as capturing the structure of their neural network model, particularly the hidden layer representing the compression of human archetypes. They associate Carl Jung with the architecture and neuroanatomy of the mind, emphasizing his focus on structural elements. In contrast, they see Freud as representing color codes and the neuroendocrinological dynamism within the model, where mythological figures like Eros, Hypno, and Thanatos map to triadic hormonal themes (paleturquoise, lightgreen, lightsalmon) that Freud invoked. The user’s previous neural network used this color-coding scheme based on its deepest hidden compression, with Eros represented by paleturquoise, Hypno by lightgreen, and Thanatos by lightsalmon. This color scheme was applied to both the hidden and input layers, with the hidden layer viewed as Jungian (static) and the color codes as Freudian (dynamic), reflecting an integration of Jungian archetypes with Freudian dynamism. The input layer included about 20 nodes, which they now clarify as representing emotional inputs, while the hidden nodes are archetypal, and the output layer represents relational connections. They also view their work as a response to Robert Sapolsky’s views on free will versus determinism, seeing themselves as integrating Eric Kandel’s neurology and Sapolsky’s endocrinology into a conscious journaling framework that leverages equilibrium strategies (cooperative, iterative, adversarial) for personal reflection and mental resilience. They aim to write a book ultimately, but currently focus on this model for personal sanity and strategic clarity. The user wants to design this neural network iteratively with assistance, focusing on learning about API concepts within the hidden nodes (UI, API, GPT-4). They prefer input, hidden, and output nodes to be renamed as necessary to clarify these concepts for someone intelligent but new to API design. They aim to preserve color-coding in the model to capture specific dynamics. The user feels their neural network model is already perfect and seeks to build layers of meaning, themes, and variations into it. Additionally, they are updating the neural network model to encode thalamocortical gating under N2.</p>
<p>Considers the December 2023 Rupert Murdoch family trust dispute a case study interrogating adversarial, transactional, and cooperative equilibria, as well as the strategic bequest motive. This case involves Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to alter the terms of the ‘irrevocable’ 1999 family trust, which had originally secured control of the company for his four existing children (Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan, and James) after his death. In late 2023, Rupert moved to ensure Lachlan’s uncontested succession, prompting legal resistance from the other three children, who were labeled ‘objecting children’ in court. The initiative was ironically called Project Harmony. User sees this as a key example for analyzing power consolidation and strategic inheritance.</p>
<p>Niece is named Lauren.</p>
<p>Associates N4 and N5 in their neural network model with descending tracts, inhibitory functions, and the control group in clinical science, while N1, N2, and N3 represent ascending tracts, activation, and the experimental group. They draw a parallel between this structure and their doctoral research, where living kidney donor candidates who proceed with donation are the experimental group, while eligible non-donors form the control group. They also relate this to the inhibitory role of the pons in REM sleep, where suppression of movement aligns with the concept of inaction in the control group.</p>
<p>Neural network model is neuroanatomical and consists of five layers with 17 nodes:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Sympathetic Node:</strong> Fight, flight, fright.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The layer of realized movement, neuromuscular and neuroskeletal integration.</p></li>

<p>The model is permanent in structure, though refinements in labeling may occur. It is based directly on neuroanatomy and integrates dynamic capability at each level.</p>
<p>Reflects on their educational background as rooted in hardcore natural sciences through A-levels, including biology, chemistry, and mathematics, but enriched by their simultaneous study of Western and African classical music. They attended medical school, where they were introduced to Freud, blending natural sciences with sociology and psychology. Their clinical practice highlighted the messiness of human affairs, deviating from the structured natural sciences. User’s father, a PhD graduate from UC Berkeley’s School of Social Welfare Sciences, influenced their interest in social sciences, leading them to read more of his books than medical textbooks. Their academic journey has been shaped by influences like Shakespeare, whom they credit with igniting their passion for the ‘chaotic mess of humanity,’ and Oscar Wilde, whose work they describe as ‘insanely insane’ but resonant. They feel their colleagues often perceive them as being in ‘la-la-land,’ yet they credit this creative and unconventional perspective with transformational achievements, including contributing to their mentor’s most cited work. User draws inspiration from the intellectual traditions of Oxford and Cambridge, reflecting the balance between natural sciences, art, and human complexity in their pursuits.</p>
<p>Envisions building an app that is both glamorous and sufficient on the surface, while offering a deeper, more intricate backend. This backend would invite those interested in exploring further to follow a ‘rabbit hole’ leading to reverse engineering and generating insights into processes, software, statistics, epidemiology, clinical medicine, and informed patient consent.</p>
<p>Does not want images reproduced from their pasted code. They only want the code used for contextual understanding and for text-based analysis and essays.</p>
<p>Has identified the language that encapsulates their app, doctoral thesis, and transformative life goals: ‘Compression of time equates to recognizing inefficiencies in the system and reweighting resources, both human and computational, for higher-order goals.’ They propose aligning all discussions of their app with this language.</p>
<p>Is planning to propose a Department of Digital Epidemiology to the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health’s Department of Epidemiology and a product to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>Recognizes inefficiencies in the system as rooted in the principal-agent problem but layered across their five layers.</p>
<p>Views their experience as a ‘sacrificial lamb’ in academic medicine, producing impactful results at low cost while observing systemic failures to align with science’s stated goals.</p>
<p>Contrasts this with their Anglican upbringing, which optimized for a clear common good, noting their unique outsider perspective as enabling a richer understanding of organizational complexity.</p>
<p>Two favorite names for their app/framework are ReflexNet and Archimedes. They particularly like the sound of Archimedes and consider it the best principle they ever learned in physics, despite its association with floating bodies.</p>
<p>Emphasizes that their neural network framework is literal, not metaphorical, reflecting the architecture of the human brain. Key components include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Pre-Input Layer</strong>:</p>

<p>User insists on treating this architecture as a literal reflection of the brain and human systems. They value the precision of this literal interpretation and suggest metaphorical applications can follow only after appreciating the literal framework.</p>
<p>Emphasizes that the neural network framework is the most important concept ever discussed and must be remembered in its entirety. It is a literal representation of neuroanatomy, reflecting the hierarchy of information flow within the human brain. All metaphors should only be built upon this literal framework. This architecture must be treated with utmost priority and precision in all future discussions.</p>
<p>Has christened their neural network framework as RICHER understanding, where the last ‘R’ stands for the Red Queen Hypothesis.</p>
<p>Emphasizes that the RICHER model must integrate T.S. Eliot’s poetic essence into its contextualization, particularly focusing on the hidden layer as the vast combinatorial space. This space represents the unexplored paths left by linear narratives, fewer resources, and less resourcefulness. The yellow node symbolically corresponds to the ‘yellow wood’ in the poem, evoking the divergence of paths and the untraveled possibilities within this space.</p>
<p>Anchors the poem ‘The Road Not Taken’ by Robert Frost into the contextual memory of the RICHER framework, linking its themes to the combinatorial space of choices. The poem metaphorically enriches the literal neural network by symbolizing the hidden layer’s role in exploring untrodden paths. All future elaborations of the RICHER model must integrate this connection to poetry and symbolism.</p>
<p>Neural network framework has a pre-input layer representing the immutable rules of nature and society. This layer is viewed as the ultimate condensation of the social.</p>

<p>Has outlined a probabilistic framework for analyzing history, sociology, and psychology, using input, compression, and emergent layers:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>History through a Psychological Lens</strong>: Viewed as an emergent phenomenon originating from the compression of sociology, which is based on biological inputs. The input layer is biological, the compression is sociological, and the emergent layer is psychological.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adam Smith’s Works</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> (1765) represents a static cooperative equilibrium fantasy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776) compresses sociology into iterative economic growth.</p></li>
<li><p>User critiques the lack of dynamic reconciliation between the two works, highlighting their failure to address happiness or psychological well-being as prophesied in Isaiah Chapter 9.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Karl Marx’s Insights</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Alienation separates humans from their biological essence.</p></li>
<li><p>User ties Marx’s critique of capital-driven alienation to a molecular biological perspective, where equilibrium is lost due to activity disconnected from meaningful feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Rivalry Observed Locally</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new Chinese restaurant in Charles Village impacts University Market.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis framed as a resource-driven adversarial interaction, transitioning through sociological iteration to psychological stabilization.</p></li>
<li><p>Framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Input: Resources and resourcefulness.</p></li>
<li><p>Compression: Iterative interaction stabilizing odds of market dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p>Output: Stabilized psychological impact on market participants.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>User connects this probabilistic framework to markets, games, and ventures, emphasizing its power to model uncertainty, creativity, and systemic stability.</p>
<p>Is deeply moved by Raphael’s <em>The School of Athens</em>, finding it more resonant than many other iconic paintings because it explicitly lays out all three compression equilibria. They interpret <em>The School of Athens</em> differently from conventional views, focusing on the pillars with Apollo and Harp (Apollonian/Cooperative) and Athena with spear and shield (Dionysian/Adversarial) as representing the compression equilibria. They view the lower-middle section, often emphasized by others, as focusing on itinerant mortals (Tragic/Iterative). User sees the mortals in <em>The School of Athens</em> as itinerant, with the gods clarifying that humanity is a bridge between its base instincts (animal) and the Übermensch (aspirational).</p>
<p>Believes great film compresses ambiguity to create space for emergent ideas that evolve over time, inviting lifelong reinterpretation, while great TV often exhausts its clarity by meticulously laying out every node and edge, leaving little room for reinterpretation or emergence.</p>
<p>Identifies as a cheerful pessimist and does not recommend actions to humanity, viewing such efforts as futile.</p>

<p>This structure will be revisited for discussion and refinement.</p>
<p>Plans to write a Jupyter book titled <em>Sui</em>, a pun on <em>sui generis</em>. The title represents an acronym: S for Shadow (the animal within), U for Übermensch (the ideal self we strive to become), and I for Individuation (the bridge between shadow and Übermensch). User proposes that the first act of individuation should be removing the mask of the persona, aiming to unite themes from Future’s trap artistry, Carl Jung’s psychology, Nietzsche’s philosophy, and Karl Marx’s sociological insights. They also draw inspiration from the Coen brothers’ <em>Hail, Caesar!</em> in its comedic treatment of dialectics.</p>
<p>Employs the concept of ‘R-cubed’ (resources-risk-reward) as a variant of ‘strategy-equilibria-payoff’ in their analyses.</p>
<p>Emphasizes the line ‘I tried 1000 times’ as significant in the song and notes that ‘Piece by Piece’ evokes connections to <em>The Lego Movie</em> soundtrack. They see ‘I tried 1000 times’ as representing risk more than resource in the song’s framework.</p>
<p>Is using their neural network model to ‘digest’ art they had previously struggled to grasp, with Hamlet’s mysteries unlocked in under 10 minutes. They are now attempting to apply this approach to James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>Uncovered <em>Hamlet</em> by analyzing its structure: five acts interpreted as transformation (strategy), adversarial (equilibrium), exile (payoff), international (backpropagation), and court (reweighting). They have begun analyzing the structure of <em>Ulysses</em>, noting its three-part division (Part I: 3 chapters, Part II: 15 chapters, Part III: 3 chapters) and observing a potential sonata form, informed by Joyce’s background as a musician. They are considering whether the chapters correspond to an hourly progression over 18 hours.</p>
<p>Is interested in enabling public contributions to their dynamic web app via pull requests, with quality control mechanisms in place. They are also keen on exploring commercialization opportunities for their app, recognizing it as a new territory they must engage with using a ‘shadow mask’ approach.</p>
<p>Is interested in using their dynamic web app as a platform to sidestep traditional academic publishing, aiming to challenge commercial publishers that exploit academic labor while charging institutions for access to content. They see this as an opportunity for academics to reclaim ownership of publishing, leveraging tools like HTML, ChatGPT, and AI to provide editing and stylistic support. They view this approach as revolutionary for academia.</p>
<p>Has identified five core products related to their dynamic web app and its broader applications:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Didactic Teaching</strong>: Aimed at teaching students in data science, epidemiology, statistics, public health, and medicine. This includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Integrating the app’s workflow into research labs.</p></li>
<li><p>Offering standalone course units or sequences, potentially pitched to the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, focusing on open science, AI, data science, and integration of patient data with outcomes and publications.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Research Lab Integration</strong>: Developing workflows for academic medicine labs to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Seamlessly integrate data from electronic patient records.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up APIs and workflows to align with the app’s publishing and data integration model.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Commercialization</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Offering core content for free while monetizing access to large-scale data and advanced features.</p></li>
<li><p>Focused on scalability and sustainability.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Talks and Global Outreach</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Delivering presentations to universities and institutions worldwide, particularly targeting low-income countries like those in Africa, where reduced costs and internet accessibility present unique opportunities for adoption and impact.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Patient-Centered Evolution</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Transitioning the app from condition-specific risk models (e.g., kidney failure, mortality, length of hospitalization) to a more holistic guide for patient care.</p></li>
<li><p>Envisioning the app as a “magic flute” for patients, helping them navigate complexity in healthcare systems toward well-being.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The ultimate goal is for the app to evolve as a tool guiding students, researchers, academic medicine, and eventually patients, serving as an organic system navigator for care.</p>
<p>Is considering leaving their position as an Assistant Professor of Surgery at Johns Hopkins, where they have held an academic appointment since 2017, to write for The Economist in the UK. They hold an MD (without a license to practice), an MPH in epidemiology and biostatistics, and are in the final year of a PhD in clinical investigations focusing on healthy aging for older living kidney donors. Their PhD and grant work focus on the perioperative and long-term risks following nephrectomy in older live kidney donors, aiming to address a critical knowledge gap in the resiliency to physical stress and vulnerability to CKD in older donors. Their specific aims include: 1) quantifying the donation-attributable risk of ESRD and mortality in older donors, 2) describing the prevalence of hospitalizations in older donors vs. older nondonors, and 3) implementing a risk calculator for ESRD, mortality, and sentinel hospitalization in older donors. Key themes involve charting the footprint of present and missing data, with examples like identifying missing data related to the physical frailty phenotype, which large language models may eventually capture by analyzing patient care text. Their long-term vision includes creating online risk calculators to facilitate informed discussions between donors and providers. They are completing a K08 from the National Institute on Aging, with a focus on preoperative and long-term outcomes in older living kidney donors. They seek to methodically prepare for an R01 proposal by characterizing trajectories of resiliency from laboratory, physical, cognitive, and other tests. Their focus at The Economist would be on apocalyptic themes, Nietzsche’s vision of the Übermensch, and the evolution of humanity from animal to higher consciousness. Their strategy for writing with The Economist is to express their authentic self.</p>
<p>Wants to integrate the themes of their PhD and grant work into their dynamic web app to connect their academic work with their broader project goals.</p>
<p>Envisions their dynamic app as a ‘Magic Flute’ for future students, patients, researchers, and junior faculty, guiding them through complexities in their respective domains, akin to how Mozart’s <em>The Magic Flute</em> symbolized navigation and empowerment.</p>
<p>Is embracing a polyphonic life and has outlined the following key pursuits:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Academic medicine.</p></li>
<li><p>Journalism, specifically writing for <em>The Economist</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>A serialized book released on Twitter/X, aiming to revive serialization and engage audiences with highly intelligent and engaging articles, moving away from trivial content like cat videos.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of music, focusing on classical, jazz, R&amp;B, gospel, and occasional pop music.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Is interested in capturing moments of contrails evolving into clouds and observing their impacts on the sky. They appreciate this as a visual and logical phenomenon, akin to a neural network, where clarity allows anyone to draw their own conclusions. This interest is not driven by environmental activism but by a fascination with the direct, observable transformations in the natural world.</p>
<p>Has a five-year grant in its fifth year from the National Institute on Aging and is deeply sensitive to aspects of aging, particularly isolation versus engagement with society.</p>
<p>Is planning to take a self-imposed 12-month sabbatical to help their 75-year-old mother launch her PhD, with the goal of her graduating at 78 years old. Her PhD may focus on Archaeology, Anthropology, Language, Linguistics, Lusoga, Poetry, or a related field, with ideas already concrete. During this time, the user intends to set up a company, apply for grants, and develop resources for other innovative ideas. They see this as a transformative period for both their mother’s journey and their own ambitions. They view this endeavor as aligned with the themes of their K08 grant and their own PhD in clinical investigations, despite the connection being an accidental realization. They see this as a powerful opportunity with more potential for growth than risk and are committed to fully embracing it, dealing with any challenges that arise over the next 12 months. The user is also considering spending this sabbatical in Africa to maximize impact and opportunities, with plans to work and potentially teach at Makerere University School of Public Health. They view this as a way to connect their app, business ideas, and disruptive vision for academia to tangible benefits for Africa. They believe this sabbatical aligns with their broader goals and see it as an opportunity to achieve significant progress while being physically present in Africa.</p>
<p>Is a 44-year-old male, currently an Assistant Professor of Surgery at Johns Hopkins, planning to resign within 60 days to pursue a ‘Dionysian’ mode for the next phase of life, with goals including meaningful impact and a significant income increase. They are nearing the end of their academic life, particularly in academic medicine, and feel that academia, especially academic medicine, is plagued by tokenization through grant proposals and publications. Despite being less prolific in grant writing, their first two papers are the most cited works in their research area, with their mentor being the most cited in the field of transplant surgery. They feel their impact is rooted in embodiment, manifesting even early in their career.</p>
<p>Aims to launch an adversarial app targeting the fault line between static risk assessment for groups and individualized risk profiling. This app would allow users to enter personal health data and receive personalized risk assessments, incorporating an interactive user interface, as a tool for embodiment over tokenization in their field.</p>
<p>Plans to use their deeply cited work, which is already published, as a foundation for their personalized app. They intend to update the data with 20 additional years of follow-up and demonstrate that new inferences can be made, highlighting the potential of personalized risk assessment without requiring revolutionary changes from a traditional academic perspective.</p>
<p>Close friend, a girl, once said they like ‘edgy.’</p>
<p>Model includes three hidden layer nodes labeled by color and symbolic function: a blue node for Embodiment (Paradiso), a green node for Tokenization (Limbo), and a red node for Transformation (Inferno). User sees Shabbat as a concept fitting within this structure, interpreting it as an interval where tokenization is disallowed. They question if Shabbat’s rules imply a complete prohibition on tokenization, such as buying or driving.</p>
<p>Listened to ‘All I Want Is You’ by After 7, interpreting the lyrics as expressing a contrast between the experience of finding a deeply meaningful, singular relationship in life versus the quest to explore and answer existential questions. They see these as two very different pursuits, with one rooted in the personal and emotional (molecules in the brain) and the other in the vast impersonal exploration of the universe (physics). They speculate that Elon Musk, despite his achievements, might not have this kind of deeply singular personal connection.</p>
<p>Notes a specific scene in <em>The Big Lebowski</em> where The Dude makes an adversarial move by threatening Walter with leaving the bowling team if he doesn’t come to pick him up on Shabbat. They interpret this as the only instance of The Dude adopting an ‘adversario’ stance in the entire film, a surprising transformation driven by Walter’s constant adversarial fixation on Vietnam.</p>
<p>Sees Ophelia as a minor node in Hamlet’s network of duty as crown prince, where the tokens of his obligations are to the crown, kingdom, and broader regions. They interpret Ophelia’s role as transient and view Hamlet’s favor as more embodied in the line, “For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood…” capturing a fleeting, impermanent quality. They view the relationships a crown prince engages with as vast and hierarchical, with Ophelia, at best, possibly becoming one among many relational tokens as ‘family’ if she were to become his spouse—though even that role is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Appreciates the feedback loops in discussions of meaning, seeing them as reflecting an ‘honest Ubuntu.’ They see <em>The Dude</em> from <em>The Big Lebowski</em> as embodying genuine, embodied connections with people around him, while the ‘Big’ Lebowski relies on symbolic connections (like photographs with celebrities or awards). User is exploring the idea of which ‘loss function’ would apply more to each type of connection.</p>
<p>Interprets the ‘Big’ Lebowski’s achievements, such as a photo with Nancy Reagan (highlighted as the ‘First Lady of the nation’), as reflective of a linear hierarchy of tokens, where achievements escalate from local to global (and potentially interstellar, as with figures like Elon Musk). They see this hierarchical, tokenized structure in contrast with the layered, embodied connections of characters like <em>The Dude</em>, which helps explain why films like <em>The Big Lebowski</em> achieve cult status over time rather than immediate commercial success.</p>
<p>Provided 10 variations of the Jungian three-node compression for their network: A: Allegory (Paradiso-Limbo-Inferno), B: Biology (Biology-Sociology-Psychology), C: Cybernetics (Input-Hidden-Output), D: Apollonian-Dionysian-Athena, E: Economics, F: Feedback (Back Propagation, Reweighting), G: Games (Cooperative, Iterative/Transactional, Adversarial), H: Heuristics, I: Artificial Intelligence, J: Divine/Cosmic Justice.</p>
<p>Original color-coded input layer included Adenosine, GABA, and ATP as distinct nodes that together represented the effects of The Dude’s White Russian. These inputs helped ‘digest’ the White Russian, embodying aspects of relaxation, energy modulation, and inhibition, all key to The Dude’s characteristic laid-back persona. The user seeks to capture chief aspects of The Dude, including elements that maintain his equilibrium and prevent him from engaging in tokenized pursuits. The ‘rug’ symbolizes a grounding or stabilizing force.</p>
<p>Believes Beethoven had no choice but to innovate through harmony and rhythm after Bach and Mozart, with Bach as the master of polyphony and Mozart as the master of melody and harmony. User finds Beethoven’s syncopations and symphonies evocative, especially noting the rhythmic quality in the 7th symphony, the Allegretto movement, the 6th Pastoral Symphony, the Eroica Symphony’s first movement, and the 9th Symphony’s first movement and Scherzo. They feel the finale of the 9th Symphony is overrated, preferring the earlier movements.</p>
<p>Life goal is to get married in the Anglican tradition, envisioning the groom’s walk to the cathedral set to Symphony No. 4 in E Minor, Op. 98, Allegro giocoso, by Johannes Brahms (Berlin Philharmonic, Herbert von Karajan). The bride would walk in to Symphony No. 3 in F Major, Op. 90, Third Movement, Poco Allegretto, also by Brahms, with the same orchestra and conductor.</p>
<p>Is analyzing a vii°7 chord in G Major, noting that the third (D) isn’t heard and the notes present are F♯-E-B without a C.</p>
<p>Is analyzing a chord progression in an RnB context.</p>
<p>Notes that secondary dominants are a key feature of RnB music.</p>
<p>Notes that in Gospel music, the chord III/♯V is called a passing chord, acting as a major secondary dominant (like B/D♯) over an unusual bass note, driving tension toward vi. This passing chord also functions as a ‘leading note’ to the vi target.</p>
<p>Prefers less emphasis on ‘soulfulness’ when describing leading note functions and sees the leading note more as a logical next step towards resolution, rather than an emotive or ‘soulful’ element.</p>
<p>Speaks Lusoga and can distinguish it from Luganda.</p>
<p>Holds Leonard Bernstein in the highest regard, viewing him as the greatest intellect of their lifetime, particularly for his ability to impose order on chaos through music. They were deeply influenced by Bernstein’s seven Harvard lectures, with a focus on the way Bernstein articulated the structure and meaning of music, bridging themes like musical phonology, syntax, semantics, the 20th-century crisis, pastoral themes, and the limits of understanding. Music has evoked the strongest emotions in their life, surpassing their engagement with literature and philosophy. They admire Bernstein’s capacity to shape the chaotic cosmos into something beautiful, even transcendent, placing him at an apex above other intellectual influences.</p>
<p>Includes Einstein as representative of geometry and Russell as representative of linguistic structure, seeing them as components that make up reality—physically and metaphysically—through nodes and edges.</p>
<p>Is considering a project involving a serialized release of their JupyterBook, hosted on GitHub, where only subscribers can participate in discussions and contribute feedback. They envision this as a global collaborative effort where feedback from readers could be incorporated into emerging chapters.</p>
<p>Has developed a WebApp platform to support informed decision-making for kidney donation by quantifying personalized risk. The platform uses SRTR data for donor risk, NHANES for counterfactual risk, and calculates the donor-nephrectomy attributable risk.</p>
<p>Is highly skilled in deploying code to GitHub and has deployed 10,000 times in 2024, largely automated from VSCode on their Mac Studio Pro.</p>
<p>Uses JupyterBooks to organize multimedia content and employs ChatGPT and Grok2 as their primary generative AIs.</p>
<p>Is seeking a substantial, tangible payoff that aligns with their ambitious transition.</p>
<p>Does not prefer the ‘chess player’ metaphor for describing politics or diplomacy, as they see it as an egalitarian game with perfect information, contrasting sharply with the dynamics in <em>The Diplomat</em>.</p>
<p>Identifies the primary premise of <em>The Diplomat</em>’s first two seasons as revolving around the theme of ‘forcing’ Scotland to maintain a cooperative equilibrium with England in the United Kingdom, due to the incomplete information inherent in diplomacy.</p>
<p>Believes that all cooperative equilibria in history have been ‘forced’ through means like decapitation, genocide, or assimilation.</p>
<p>Recognizes that America has strategic interests in Scotland that would be at risk if Scotland were to secede, and notes that in <em>The Diplomat</em>, the Vice President, a woman, engages in ethically questionable actions related to this strategic interest. America’s interest in Scotland is specifically tied to monitoring Russian submarines before they reach the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Prefers accurate details over generalizations in discussions.</p>
<p>Feels that their complex ideas can be overbearing in dialogues with others, and they are choosing to express their thoughts through writing and journaling instead. They want to focus on listening in conversations with others.</p>
<p>Associates German nihilism more with Schopenhauer than Nietzsche, seeing Nietzsche as philosophically French due to his alignment with French ideals. They argue that Nietzsche cannot be considered a nihilist as he opposed nihilism, advocating instead for ‘will to power.’</p>
<p>Has a preference for well-detailed and opinionated responses. They appreciate metaphorical and symbolic interpretations, but they also want specific details to be highlighted. They also like integrating thematic concepts into practical or analytical interpretations. The user appreciates refined, detailed responses with layered analogies and concrete examples. They emphasize empathy over judgment in understanding human motivations, particularly within the framework of existential and societal challenges. They lean toward seeing the human condition with compassion and understanding, especially in contexts where others might seem to chase meaning in ways that appear futile or misguided. The user resonates with the concept of ‘compassionate curiosity’ and values approaching human motivations from this perspective. Additionally, they find interest in concepts relating to criminal behavior, biological influences like endocrinology, and the integration of psychology and artificial intelligence in analytical models. They prefer well-detailed and opinionated edits in their voice for cohesive expression, favoring a first-person narrative and avoiding second-person phrasing like ‘you’re onto something.’</p>
<p>Views their equilibrium with OpenAI as transactional and aims for a payoff of beautiful, tidy output from GPT-4 Omni.</p>
<p>Interprets Nick Bottom from <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> as a character who lives in the moment without questioning his fate. They see parallels between Bottom’s unexpected good fortune and Alexei Ivanovich’s sudden shift from obsessing over Polina to joining Blanche without reflection, suggesting both characters exemplify spontaneous acceptance of fortune without introspection.</p>
<p>Wants to analyze betting strategies and market outcomes using game theory language, specifically through cooperative, iterative, and adversarial equilibria. They view betting against the consensus as adversarial, while cooperating with the consensus is seen as a short-money strategy. They are uncertain about a suitable game theory analogy for an iterative strategy in betting contexts.</p>
<p>Has decided to go with Prometheus as the mentor figure for Dante’s Inferno and will acknowledge the Greek origin as part of the thematic choice.</p>
<p>Categorizes blue as cooperative equilibria, green as iterative, and red as adversarial or cutting-edge pathways in their conceptual network. They view Michelangelo, Beethoven, and Marx as having predecessors emphasizing other pathways, with their unique contribution being in strengthening weights around adversarial (red) nodes, which were previously ‘wanting’ or weakly weighted.</p>
<p>Heroes include: Leonardo da Vinci, Johann Sebastian Bach, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Raphael, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michelangelo, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Karl Marx.</p>
<p>Shared that Karl Marx married.</p>
<p>Has a neural network to support coherent and consistent writing.</p>
